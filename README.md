# Clip videos and generate subtitle files
These python scripts take full transect or dive length video files (.mp4) and clip them into segments of a specified length. Then using output from https://github.com/phantomboots/ROV-Tracking-Data-Processing, creates subtitle files for those video clips. Both scripts require ffmpeg command line tool to be installed.

## 1_Clip_Videos.py
This script clips full length videos using the start and end transect time from the provided dive log, starting 30 seconds before the transect start time and ending at least 30 seconds after the transect end time to provide a buffer. The video clips are saved using the same naming convention as the input videos: TripID_DiveID_YYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4.

## 2_Generate_Subtitles.py
This script reads in the csv file generated by the ROV tracking data processing code and uses the 1 Hz data stream to create the subtitle text. Formats the data stream into (.srt) subtitle files for each video clip. Position and font of subtitles can be adjusted within VLC.
